            Getting outside shouldn't be competitive or require months in advance of planning. If you live in California, like me, you know how bad it can get. The one time I got a campsite at Marin's Steep Ravine, I spent days refreshing the availability page every hour.

            So for my first web application, I wanted to build something to solve that. It was also important for the service to be free. In the coming weeks, I plan to add more campsites so options include state parks and private parks as well.

            I started coding in July 2019 and am currently in Hackbright's full-time software engineering bootcamp. This is my first web application and I hope you like it! If you have any feedback, please send it to bnmorton264@gmail.com.
