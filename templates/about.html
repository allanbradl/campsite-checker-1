                No availability at the campsite you'd like to visit? Select all of the sites you'd like to visit, add check in and check out dates, and you'll be texted when there is availability. Getting outside shouldn't be competitive or require months in advance of planning.

                I'm Brittany Morton and I started coding in July 2019. This is my first web application and I hope you like it!

                If you live in California, you know how bad booking a campground can be. The one time I got a campsite at Marin's Steep Ravine, I spent days refreshing the availability page on the hour. My hope is for this site to solve this.
