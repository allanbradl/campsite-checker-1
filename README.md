## üçÅ Wanderment 

Wanderment is a soldout campsite reservation notifier that makes getting outside easier. Users can select multiple campsites they'd like to visit for a chosen date range. The program will then check for availability every 5 minutes and send a text message via Twilio if the criteria return availability.

## Future Features
 
__Add more data__ Campsites across the US are private, public, state, and national parks. Therefore, their campsite reservations are hosted on various websites. At the moment, I am only using recreation.gov, which is national parks. I plan to add reserveCA campsites as well as. And maybe eventually add international parks like Torres del Paine. 
 
__Permit information__ Reacreation.gov also stores permit information for popular hikes such as Half Dome and Mt. Whitney.  I‚Äôd like to display key dates to users in a ‚Äòpermit‚Äô section.

__One React route__ Since the app is essentially one form, I would like to make it into one React route.
 
__Ability to login__ This would allow users to manage their requests
  
__Display most popular campgrounds on homepage__ On the landing page, display the most searched campsites to the users when they arrive at the site.
